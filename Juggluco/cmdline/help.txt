Command line program to create a Juggluco backup on a desktop computer.
Juggluco is an android applet that connects with Freestyle libre 2 sensors
and allows one to add diabetes diary data, see:
https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco
Within a certain directory (-d dir) backup and connection data is saved.
With this program, you can specify the connections the program
should receive data from and send data to.
Usages: /home/jka/bin/juggluco -d dir : save data in directory dir
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -p port : listen on port port
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -l : list configuration data
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -c : clear configuration data
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco -x[-+]: start eXport/xDrip/Nightscout web server (https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/webserver.html) or not (-x-)
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco -X[-+]:  the same but server can also be assessed remotely
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco -g secret: use as api_secret secret
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco -e[-+]:  Use web server with SSL encryption
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco -o port:  use port for the SSL server
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco -[0123456789][RLCOD] place label 0-9 in category R,L,C,O or D:
	R: Rapid acting Insulin
	L: Long acting Insulin
	C: Carbohydate
	O: cOmments
	D: Don't send
	-0R means label 0 (first one) is Rapid acting insulin
	-1C means label 1 (second) is Carbohydrate
	-2O means give label 2 as a cOmment
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -t[+]: give treatments/amounts via Nightscout interface
        /home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -N filename: export nums 
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -S filename: export scans 
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -B filename: export stream 
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -H filename: export history 
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -m filename: export meals 
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -M : mmol/L
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -G : mg/dL
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -R n : remove n-th connection
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] -Z n : resend data to n-th connection
	/home/jka/bin/juggluco -v  : version

	/home/jka/bin/juggluco [-d dir] OPTIONS IP1,IP2 ...  : Specify connection with IP(s).
OPTIONS:
	-r: receive from host
	-a: automatically detect IP the first time
	-A: Active only. Don't accept connections from this host. Only actively connect to this host.
	-P: Passive only. Never connect actively to this host. Only accepts connections.

	-n: send nums (amounts)
	-s: send scans (via NFC received data)
	-b: send stream (via bluetooth received data)

	-L label: give connection label 'label'. A connection is only established if both side specify 
		the same label.
	-i: don't test on ip
	-w password: encrypt communication with password
	-p port:  connect to port (default: 8795)

	-C n: overwrite n-th connection. If this program sends to this connection, data will not be resend. 

example:

/home/jka/bin/juggluco -d mydir -r  192.168.1.64

Receive data from host 192.168.1.64 (an ip shown in backup screen android app)
In the juggluco android applet you can in "backup, add connection"
specify send to amounts, scans and stream and specify port 8795 and
an ip of this computer (e.g 192.168.1.68)

/home/jka/bin/juggluco -d mydir -nsb  192.168.1.69

Send the amounts, scans and stream data to 192.168.1.69 on the default port (8795)
In the android applet you can in the "add connection" dialog, specify 
an ip of this computer (192.168.1.68) check "Receive from" and specify as port 8795
(the port specified earlier for this computer)

/home/jka/bin/juggluco -d mydir

Starts the program with this configuration.
