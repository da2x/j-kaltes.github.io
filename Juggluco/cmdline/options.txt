Command line program to create a Juggluco backup on a desktop computer.
Juggluco is an android applet that connects with Freestyle libre 2 sensors
and allows one to add diabetes diary data, see:
https://j-kaltes.github.io/Juggluco
Within a certain directory (-d dir) backup and connection data is saved.
With this program, you can specify the connections the program
should receive data from and send data to.
Usages: ./juggluco -d dir : save data in directory dir
        ./juggluco [-d dir] -p port : listen on port port
        ./juggluco [-d dir] -l : list configuration data
        ./juggluco [-d dir] -c : clear configuration data
        ./juggluco [-d dir] -N filename: export nums 
	./juggluco [-d dir] -S filename: export scans 
	./juggluco [-d dir] -B filename: export stream 
	./juggluco [-d dir] -H filename: export history 
	./juggluco [-d dir] -m filename: export meals 
	./juggluco [-d dir] -M : mmol/L
	./juggluco [-d dir] -G : mg/dL
	./juggluco [-d dir] -R n : remove n-th connection


	./juggluco [-d dir] OPTIONS IP1,IP2 ...  : Specify connection with IP(s).
OPTIONS:
	-r: receive from host
	-a: automatically detect IP the first time
	-g: signal reconnect 

	-n: send nums (amounts)
	-s: send scans (via NFC received data)
	-b: send stream (via bluetooth received data)

	-w password: encrypt communication with password
	-p port:  connect to port (default: 8795)

example:

./juggluco -d mydir -r  192.168.1.64

Receive data from host 192.168.1.64 (an ip shown in backup screen android app)
In the juggluco android applet you can in "backup, add connection"
specfiy send to amounts, scans and stream and specify port 8795 and
an ip of this computer (e.g 192.168.1.71)

./juggluco -d mydir -nsb  192.168.1.69

Send the amounts, scans and stream data to 192.168.1.69 on the default port (8795)
In the android applet you can in the "add connection" dialog, specify 
an ip of this computer (192.168.1.71) check "Receive from" and specify as port 8795
(the port specified earlier for this computer)

./juggluco -d mydir

Starts the program with this configuration.
