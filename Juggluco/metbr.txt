<br>- If "sensor via Bluetooth" is unchecked or Juggluco can't search for sensors because it doesn't have location permission, Juggluco doesn't enable streaming anymore. In previous versions, Juggluco always took over the Bluetooth connection with the sensor after scanning. If you scanned the sensor one time with another smartphone, you had to scan the sensor again with the original smartphone to get the Bluetooth connection back. Now there is a way to turn that off.
<br>- AGP like summary statistics: percentage in certain glucose ranges, GMI, Glucose Variability and a summery graph showing below which value lie at each minute of the day 0%,5%,25%,50%,75%,95% or 100% of the values.
