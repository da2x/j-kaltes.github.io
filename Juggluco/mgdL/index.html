    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> Juggluco (juggle glucose) is an alternative
      android app for Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors, meant for glucose
      control by people with diabetes. Beside the current value received by
      scans and the 15 minutes values out of the memory of the sensor, it also
      displays the current glucose value received every minute via Bluetooth
      (which Abbott's Librelink 2.5.3 only uses for glucose alarms).</p>

          showing current glucose value received by Bluetooth</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The value received via Bluetooth is exactly the same as the one received by scanning. And these same values will also be used in the sensor to generate the history values of the past 8 hours you also receive by scanning.
So the question remains why Abbott doesn't display the values, it uses for alarms, on the screen?
I think that it went like this: The decision makers in the organization were quite satisfied with their sensors, but recognized that low and high glucose alarms had an advantage. So they asked if somehow alarms could be added to their scanned sensors. This was done and the whole plan went never beyond adding these alarms. That this way you could also get the same value without scanning and thus making scanning unnecessary, stayed out of the picture. They kept to their original plan. Only when designing a new sensor (the Libre3) did they recognize this fact.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">Apps
        like the official Librelink app from Abbott display the glucose graph in
        a very reduced form in portrait mode, which maybe allows a doctor to see
        in a glimpse how well one is doing, but is insufficient for a diabetes
        patient to see exactly how the glucose curve (its peaks and troughs)
        relates to other events like carbohydrate, insulin doses or physical
        activity.</span></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Juggluco uses the whole
      screen in landscape mode for the glucose curve. With two fingers you can
      zoom the time axis in or out without any restriction (you can disable this
      in settings). Abbott has an obligatory display of glucose values from 0 to
      378 mg/dL (0-21 mmol/L), in Juggluco you can configure this in settings
      with any range you like (or change it manually by moving up and down if
      allowed in settings). The amount of insulin or food you consume can be
      added to the graph, so you can see its relation with the glucose values. </p>

    <p>By simply moving over the screen left or right you can move the curve
      backwards and forwards in time. Beside this the app contains four menus,
      opened by touching different fourths of the screen. The right most menu is
      the movement menu, by which you can move one day or one week back in time
      with one extra touch after opening the menu with a first touch. Beside
      this you can jump to a specific date or search for a specific glucose
      value or amount of food or insulin or whatever number you entered.</p>

      low and high glucose value alarms. For each of which you can specify
      separate ringtones in the settings. Beside this you can add medication
      reminders, setting an alarm to go off if you didn't enter a certain amount
      in a certain time interval. For example if you didn't enter long acting
      insulin between 9 and 10 in the evening.</p>

      <li><span lang="en-US">Librelink needs an e-mail address and password and
          regular contact with a server for I don't know what reasons. The last
          time I had to press a few times on accept related to altered
          conditions of use, but did Librelink know that before it made contact
          with the server? One time on holiday in an area without mobile
          internet connection, Librelink refused to function without internet
          connection. Happily I already had Juggluco, which doesn't use a
          server. Most of the activity of Librelink consists of Firebase
          Analytics gathering information on you smartphone. Juggluco doesn't
          use firebase analytics. Librelink sends all your glucose measurements
          to their server (as you can see in Libreview), Juggluco doesn't.<br>

    </figure>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">With the mirror function
      you can send data via IP/TCP from one Juggluco to another Juggluco running
      on another Android device. This has all kind of uses: transfer of you data
      to a new phone or display it on an android tablet or android emulator to
      have a larger display. You can also set alarms in the mirror device. With
      the scan data the mirror app also receives the Bluetooth connection data,
      making it possible for <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/mirror/index.html">devices without NFC to connect via Bluetooth with the sensor</a>.&nbsp; You can
      also display exactly the same data on a second phone that is connected
      over the internet to a phone running Juggluco connected to the sensor (see <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/phones/index.html">details</a>). There is also a desktop command line program that can
      receive data from and resend data to Juggluco (with the program found <a
        href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/cmdline/index.html" title="Juggluco cmdline">here</a>).&nbsp; </p>
    <h5 style=" margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Values</h5>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> The glucose values
      received by Bluetooth differ little from the scanned values of Abbott's
      Libre/Librelink app. The values displayed in Juggluco and Abbott's Libre
      app are determined the same way, but previous readings influence displayed
      values. This can make that if you use one of them longer, they will give
      somewhat different values. When used beside each other, differences will
      diminish with time.</p>
    <h5 style="  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Librelinks alarms stop
      working</h5>
    <p>Librelinks alarms won't work anymore after using Juggluco. Not everyone
      can just receive data via Bluetooth from a sensor. For this you need to
      generate the right authentication information which is determined while
      scanning. You don't read it out of the sensor, but generate it. It is
      therefore different from what the Librelink app uses.&nbsp; When Juggluco
      and Librelink run on the same device and you let Juggluco get a connection
      before starting Librelink, Librelink will also generate alarms. But this
      adds nothing and probably makes that Juggluco get more problems gaining a
      connection when Librelink is the first trying to use the wrong
      authentication information. When Juggluco runs on a watch and Librelink on
      a phone, running in parallel is absolutely impossible and Librelink will
      have a strong negative impact on the connection of Juggluco. Multiple apps
      trying to connect with the sensor, has a much stronger negative impact on
      Freestyle Libre 3 sensors; when both try to get a connection a the same
      time (even on the same device), neither will succeed.</p>
    <p>Previously I thought that the Librelink app will never re-enable alarms
      after another app or device had a Bluetooth connection with the sensor,
      but I found a method: When you logout the Librelink app and later login
      with another Libreview account, alarms will work after you scan the
      sensor. Hereafter Juggluco will lose contact with the sensor and the only
      way to get it back is the scan the sensor a few times with Juggluco in the
      foreground after Juggluco has discovered that its authentication
      information doesn't work anymore.</p>
    <h5>Connection</h5>
      <p>If the sensor is already connected with Libre app or reader, it will
not get a connection with Juggluco. This is especially important in
the beginning, because later they can't get a connection with the
sensor anymore and only compete trying to get a connection. On my own smartphone running Librelink doesn't seem to disrupt the connection of Juggluco with the sensor, but Juggluco always got a connection soon after starting the sensor (mostly I started the sensor with Juggluco, so Librelink doesn't even try to connect with the sensor.)</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">So after you have
scanned the sensor a few times with Juggluco, you have to disrupt
this connection:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span lang="en-US">Maybe
	turning Bluetooth OFF and ON is effective;</span>
	<li><span lang="en-US">Turn
	OFF alarms of the Libre app and Freestyle reader;</span>
	<li><span lang="en-US">Revoke Location and Nearby devices permission;</span>
	<li><span lang="en-US">Force close the Libre2 app;</span>
	<li><span lang="en-US">Wipe the Libre2 app out of the recent tasks screen;</span>
	<li><span lang="en-US">Better, disable the Libre app.</span>

</ul>


      <p>If you have
      installed Abbott's Libre/Librelink app, you can just install Juggluco from
      <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/download.html">Here</a>, scan two times and after some time a Bluetooth connection will
      be established and a new glucose value will arrive every minute. Before
      the Bluetooth values arrive, the values received by scanning will be
      shown.</p>
    <p>From Juggluco 2.2.1 on, Juggluco can connect directly with US Freestyle
      Libre 2 sensors.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>After scanning something like the right picture above is shown. The
      number is the 'current' glucose value, the curve displays the glucose
      pattern of the past 16 minutes and is taken out of the sensor by NFC
      scanning. Abbott's Librelink app uses these values only to determine the
      angle of the arrow that displays the direction of change. The curve,
      Juggluco displayed after scanning, is drawn directly from the raw values
      and differs a bit from the values received via Bluetooth for which
      Abbott's calibration algorithm is used. With Freestyle libre 2, NFC
      scanning has become of minor interest. You only need it to startup the
      sensor, enable Bluetooth streaming and now and then to find out what is
      wrong and to get the sensor working again. </p>
<h2 class="western">Age</h2>

    </figure>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To display the age
of the displayed glucose value, the Sensor Identifier under the
glucose value, is colored in proportion of how long ago the glucose
value is received from the sensor. The total length of the Sensor
identifier is 3 minutes, thus if the Sensor Identifier is totally
colored it was 3 minutes ago the glucose value was received from the
sensor. If more then three minutes have passed since the last glucose
value was received, it isn't displayed anymore. Immediately after a
new glucose value has arrived the sensor id isn't colored at all,
after one minute it is colored for a third. The screen is only
refreshed on every minute tick or when the user touches the screen,
thus not all degrees of age are immediately shown on the screen. If
you want a number of the time of the measurement, you can save the
glucose values with Left middle screen-&gt;Export-&gt;Stream.
Touching the last point of the glucose curve will also display the
measurement time of that value.</p>
<h2>Unmeasurable extremes</h2>
<p>
Values below 40 mg/dL are displayed as <b>40></b>, meaning that 40 is larger than the real value. In Librelink this is show as LO. I myself didn't consider that very handy, especially in the beginning: at the moment you have to eat glucose as quickly as possibly you first have to find out what that LO means.
</p>
<p>
Values above 500 mg/dL are display <b>500<</b>, meaning that 500 is smaller than the real value. In Librelink this is displayed as HI.
</p>
    <h2> FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor differences </h2>
    The Libre 2 sensors in the USA are different from those in Germany or the
    Netherlands. I received a report that US like sensors are also used in
    Australia. You can use US-like sensors with Juggluco (from version 2.2.0),
    but you can't activate them. So a new sensor should first be scanned with an
    Abbott Libre 2 app. If you somehow got a US Freestyle Libre 2 sensor, but
    can't get a Libre2 app for that sensor from Google Play, you can use the <a
      href="https://www.juggluco.nl/USLibre2">patched US Libre 2 app</a>
    to activate the sensor.</p><p>The official unpatched US Libre 2 app, refuses to scan sensors it hasn't activated. If Juggluco could activate a US sensor, users would reproach me for not being able to scan the sensor with the US Libre 2 app because they have started the sensor with Juggluco.</p><p>You can see what kind of FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor you are using by looking in Left-Menu-> Sensor in Juggluco. If the device address (the hex number before streaming enabled) is red, it is a US-like sensor. Please tell me if you use a US-like sensor outside the USA; I like to know which countries outside the US use US-like sensors, so that I can make Juggluco Wear smaller and/or faster by distributing different versions to different countries.</p>

    <h2 class="western"> Sensor error differences</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
Sensor errors (373, wait 10 minutes) are usually generated in Juggluco at exactly the same moment they are generated in the Libre app. An exception is that older version of the librelink app sometimes don't generate sensor errors when never versions do.
So if someone compares the patched Librelink 2.3.0 app with Juggluco, he will sometimes see that Juggluco generates a sensor error, but the patched Librelink 2.3.0 will not.</p>
<h2>FreeStyle Libre 3</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
With Juggluco 3.0.0, it is also possible to connect Freestyle Libre 3 sensors directly with Juggluco: <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/libre3">More info</a>.</p>

      font than values consisting of a single digit. Some may have preferred
      consistency over readability, but I prefer the latter.</p>
    <p> On some smartphones you have to change the notifications settings to see
      the current glucose value in the Android status bar and/or on the lock
      screen. How you can do this is device dependent. In Android settings you
      can find somewhere notifications. From a list of apps you can select
      Juggluco and under Juggluco glucoseNotification and then you have all kind
      of options, like "Set as silent" (unset), "display on status bar" (set)
      and "hide details on lock screen" (unset).</p>
    <p>On Android 13 you should give Juggluco <i>Notifications permission</i></p>
    <p>It is possible that with a certain combination of lock screen color
      settings, only the icon is visible. Switching to dark mode helps.</p>
    <p>Don't set <i>"Icon only"</i> in your lock screen settings.</p>
    <p>On some smartphones, only notifications generated after the screen was
      locked are displayed, so you will not seen immediately whether the the
      change of settings was effective. </p>

    <h2>Watch</h2>
    <p>If you have a smartwatch that can receive Android notifications, you can
      select Notify in the left middle menu of Juggluco to let Juggluco generate
      an alerting android notification every time a new glucose value arrived by
      Bluetooth. If you configure your smartwatch app to send notifications from
      Juggluco to the watch, you will receive this notification on your watch,
      so you can look every minute at your watch for you current glucose level.
      This can by useful during physical activity.</p>
    <p>There is also a special watch app for some Garmin watches with
      touchscreen (see <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Kerfstok/index.html">Kerfstok</a>),
      wherein you can see your current glucose value, enter numbers and display
      speed and distance during activity and record it.</p>
    <p>Juggluco (version 2.1.0 and up) has a build-in xDrip web server. This
      means that xDrip watch apps can receive glucose values directly from
      Juggluco. You can turn this on in the <i>left menu-&gt;watch</i> of
      Juggluco. Use the Help button there for more information.</p>

    <p>There is now a Juggluco version that runs on WearOS. See <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/JugglucoWearOS/index.html">https://www.juggluco.nl/JugglucoWearOS</a> for more information.

    <h1 style=" line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Aggregate data</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Starting with version
      1.1.22 Juggluco can display some summary statistics of the stream data
      received via Bluetooth. </p>

      <figcaption><span style="font-size: 0.9em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Summary
          graph</span></figcaption> </figure>
    <p>You can see the percentage of measurements falling in certain glucose
      ranges. Both for the conventional ranges (&gt;250 mg/dL, 181-250 mg/dL,
      70-180 mg/dL, 54-69 mg/dL, &lt;54 mg/dL) as the target range specified in
      settings. In the above image it is 72-144 mg/dL.</p>
    <p>Glucose Management Indicator is an empirically determined predictor of
      HbA1c taken from Bergenstal et al (2018) <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/41/11/2275">https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/41/11/2275</a>.</p>
    <p> The summary graph is made as follows: Of every minute of the day it is
      determined how the glucose values were distributed over a give number of
      days. For example for the first minute of the day, all measurements of
      this minute for every day in this period are taken and it is determine
      under which value 50% of the values lie to get the median. For the 100%
      range, the lowest and highest values on that minute of the day in this
      period are taken. For the 90% range the values below which 5% of the
      values lie and the values below which 95% of the values lie is taken. For
      the 50% range the value below which 25% of the values lie and the value
      below which 75% of the values lie. This for every minute of the day.
      Thereafter these borders/lines are smoothed.</p>
    <p>The specific period for which these calculations are done, can be
      determined by setting the number of days by pressing <i>Days</i> and by
      the end position of the screen at the moment <i>Stats</i> in the left
      middle menu was touched. The time point of the end position of the screen
      is the end of the period over which these calculations are done, going
      back the number of days specified in <i>Days</i>, or 14 days by default.</p>
    <p>With <i>Export</i> in the left middle menu data can be saved in tab
      separated format (.tsv), thereafter you can also analyze the data whatever
      statistics software you like. In the following link is shown how you can
      do this using the R package Iglu.

      </p>
<h1 style="line-height: 108%; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Receive glucose values</h1>
<p>Starting with Juggluco 4.1.0, other apps can receive glucose
values from a <a href="glucosebroadcast.html">glucose broadcast</a> 
</p>
<p>In Juggluco's settings you can configure Juggluco to send its
glucose value to other apps. Juggluco can send three types of such
broadcasts.</p>
<p>The Librelink broadcast was originally used by the patched
Librelink app and can be used to send glucose values to <a href="https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases">xDrip</a>.
</p>
<p>The xDrip local broadcast was originally used by xDrip and can be
used to send glucose values to <a href="https://wiki.aaps.app/en/latest/Getting-Started/FAQ.html">AAPS</a>.</p>
<p>The Glucodata broadcast came with Juggluco and can be sent to
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.trupici.g_watch">G-Watch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pachi81/GlucoDataHandler/releases">GlucoDataHandler</a></p>
<h2 class="western">LibreView</h2>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
In settings, you can also ask Juggluco to sent glucose values to
Libreview. For this it creates data points for every 15 minutes, by
averaging the stream values around that point, so you don't need to
scan to make use of it. In Libreview you can select &quot;<i>Download
Glucose Data</i>&quot; to download these data to a .csv file. This data can be imported in apps like Diabetes:M.</p>
<p>In Libreview under <i>Account Settings-&gt;My Devices</i> you can
delete all data send to Libreview from a particular device. So if you
don't like the data or want to send everything anew with a new
version of Juggluco, you can do that. Maybe it is a good idea, to
<i>decline to share your glucose and product-related data for the
purposes of research</i> under <i>Account Settings-&gt;Profile</i> 
</p>
<p>To send also Amounts of insulin, carbohydrate etc. to Libreview
you have to specify for each label what should be done with it
(Settings-&gt;Libreview-&gt;Send amounts).</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
I have to mention that you can also save glucose values in Juggluco
itself, by going to Left middle menu-&gt; export and select Stream,
in this case you get a value for every minute. To view some
statistics of these data you can go to Left middle menu-&gt;
Statistics (see Aggregate data).</p>
<h1 id="calibration"> No manual calibration</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Freestyle Libre 1
and 2 sensors as used by Abbott Librelink app are not manually
calibrated; Finger prick glucose measurements are not used to adjust
the sensor readouts. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Some people demand
that Juggluco should add manual calibration. I don't know the exact
reason why. Some may not known that Freestyle Libre sensors are factory calibrated. But I think that the reason is that they see a
discrepancy between the sensor readout and the finger prick glucose
value and hope by adjusting the sensor readout it will better
approach the finger prick.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">In Juggluco you
can't manually calibrate, because I am afraid it will make it worse.
When I look at my own glucose measurements, they don't diverse always
in the same direction. The direction will also depend on what moments
you do your finger pricks. If you check always a low sensor readout,
you will find that the sensor readings are too low. If you do a
finger prick when you sense a hypo, but the sensor doesn't show one,
you will find that the sensor gives too high values.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">For some time I have
sent the sensor glucose values from Juggluco to xDrip and have
entered all my finger pricks as calibration data in xDrip. As a
results the readings of xDrip were much worse than the not manually
calibrated values of Juggluco.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Why should other
users do better?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
There is also the difficulty of sensor range. The sensor doesn't give
values lower than 40 mg/dL. If the sensor values are more than 31
mmol/L lower than blood glucose, it can't detect hypoglycemia
anymore. If the sensor gives LO (lower than 40 mg/dL), it means in
reality lower than 76 mg/dL when it's readings are 36 mg/dL too low.
So it can be 76 mg/dL (nothing to worry about) are 26 mg/dL (at the
border of getting unconscious.) If a sensor readings consistently
diverges so much from the blood glucose, you shouldn't use the sensor
anymore.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Getting a
replacement from Abbott can give difficulties. Although they easily
replace sensors that fall off, they do very difficult when you want a
replacement because of poor readings. Probably they think that the
sensors are always so bad, so that replacement doesn't make a
difference.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Here is a list of
restrictions, based on a <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/AbbottComparison.eml">dutch
e-mail I received from Abbott</a>: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You shouldn't
	use the readings of a sensor for the first 24 hours of placement;</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Only trust the
	sensor when the glucose level is stable (<i>bij voorkeur nadat je de
	sensor 24 uur hebt gedragen en/ of er sprake is van een stabiele
	situatie ten aanzien van de glucosewaarden (de trendpijl op de
	reader en/ of FreeStyle LibreLink app horizontaal</i>));</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You should not
	compare them with blood at the moment of scanning, but blood 5 to 10
	minutes before, because the sensors are so much behind compared to
	blood glucose (<i>Wacht na de vingerprik 5-10 minuten en scan dan de
	FreeStyle Libre sensor. </i>);</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You should
	measure the blood three times at different moment of the same day
	(<i>Indien je de meting uit het ISV wilt vergelijken met jouw
	bloedglucose dan vragen wij je minimaal een drietal metingen op
	verschillende tijdstippen gedurende dezelfde dag te nemen. )</i>;</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You should do
	another measurement together with the Abbott customer service (<i>Hou
	indien mogelijk de sensor op de arm. Wij kunnen dan samen nog een
	test uitvoeren. </i>)</p>
</ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">From the telephone
      conversation with Abbott customer service I understood that they consider
      less than 30% off as acceptable. This seemed to be calculated as the
      absolute difference divided by the sensor value. Sensor measurement  33
      mg/dL and a blood glucose measurement of 88 mmol/L was interpreted as
      more than 100% difference.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">How the different
measurements are integrated I don't know, but it sounds like they
only accept that the sensor is wrong if it diverges at all occasions.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I had a sensor that
was off 72 mg/dL and the customer service didn't accept that as a
fault of the sensor, because I had only scanned at the moment of the
blood glucose measurement.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The IOS port will
have limited functionality compared with the Android version. Using a
phone in isolation will be impossible, but it would be possible to
use the IOS phone in connection with a WearOS watch or a server
running on a Linux computer. Iphone user who have a WearOS watch
would than be able to start the sensor with the IOS phone.
Thereafter, they could connect the sensor with the WearOS watch and
display the data, received on the watch, on Juggluco on the Iphone.
Now they need an Android phone with Juggluco on it to start the
sensor and need to display the data on a Nightscout IOS app.</p>
