<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Sensor</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The spinner contains
the name of the sensor. If Juggluco is using more than one sensor at
the same time, you can select for which sensor to show information.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Doze mode</b></i>
leads you to a screen with information on how to disable battery
optimizations for Juggluco, that can prevent Juggluco from
functioning.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Permission</b></i>:
Previous versions of Juggluco required location permission to find
the device address of the sensor. This is no longer necessary for the
sensors I use. Maybe there are still sensors out there for which it
is necessary; in that case you can turn it on. After the first
contact Juggluco saves the device address and location permission is
always useless. The device address, if known, is displayed after the
sensor identifier. Red means a US-like sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Android 12 has a new
Nearby devices permission, which can be used instead of location
permission for searching for a Bluetooth device address, but it is
also needed for later contact with Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Wakelock</b></i>:
Some users of Android 13 complain that Bluetooth stops functioning.
Possibly turning this option on helps them. On my smartphone I don't
need it and on Watch4 it doesn't make a difference. If it works, it
will increase battery usage.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Forget</b></i>:
Forgets the device address and search for it by scanning for
Bluetooth devices like Librelink does everywhere except in the USA.
For this you need Location permission on Android 6 to 11. On Android
12 you require Nearby devices permission. You should press this
button if you believe that Abbott was right everywhere except in the
USA.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Reenable</b></i>:
Re-enable streaming. New authentication information is created to
communicate with the sensor. The device address will be set. Takes
effect after scanning the sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Turbo</b></i>:
Increases effort to contact with sensor in the hope that it results
in less connection errors, but can uses more battery power. Seems to
be needed on Watch4 with Freestyle Libre 2 sensors, but not with
Freestyle Libre 3 sensors and on none of the smartphones I tried it
on.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><i><b>Info</b></i>:
Gives start and end times and last scan and stream times of sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To connect to a
Freestyle Libre 2 sensor via Low Energy Bluetooth, Bluetooth should
be turned on. Before the sensor is scanned successfully by this app,
nothing will happen. The sensor shouldn't be connected with FreeStyle
Libre reader or other applets on smartphones. Abbotts Librelink app's
alarms should be turned off or the app stopped. Some Librelink apps
seem to contact the sensor while alarms are turned off and can cause
connection problems, so use '<i>force stop</i>' to be certain. <b>Sensor
via Bluetooth/Use Bluetooth</b> should be turned on.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If the above
conditions are satisfied, it can still take a long time before the
app receives glucose values from the sensor. Often it takes a minute,
but at other times it takes much longer. The <i>Connection stage</i>
gives the most difficulties. The most frequent are failures with
status=133, which is the status argument of
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback#onConnectionStateChange(android.bluetooth.BluetoothGatt,%20int,%20int)">onConnectionStateChange(BluetoothGatt
bluetoothGatt, int status, int newState)</a>. If you remove the
battery out of a sensor you also get this error, so it seems to be
something like <i>Bluetooth device not found</i>. Sometimes turning
Bluetooth off and on seems to help or rebooting the phone or turning
off the Bluetooth connection of other devices. Other problems are
sometimes resolved by scanning the sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Scanning the sensor
with Juggluco (with <i>Sensor via Bluetooth</i> enabled) on another
phone, will steal the connection away from this phone and it can take
some time, with scanning in between, to get it back again.</p>
