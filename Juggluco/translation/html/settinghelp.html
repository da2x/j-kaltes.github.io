<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1 class="western">Settings</h1>
<h2 class="western">Unit</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Select whether
glucose values should be given in mmol/L or dm/dL.</p>
<h2 class="western">Graph range: low-high.</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Give a low and high
value, so that the bottom of the screen correspondents to the lowest
and the top to the highest. These values are only used when all the
glucose values displayed on the screen are within these bounds.
Otherwise, the bounds are widened so that all values are visible.
When you take 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) and 9 mmol/L (162 mg/dL), and all
the values on the visible display are between 5 mmol/L and 6 mmol/L,
the graph displays a glucose axis from 3 to 9. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If <b>Manually scale
Glucose</b> is turned on, you can change this: moving your finger
over the top of the screen, moves the top half of the graph up and
down; moving over the bottom of the screen moves the bottom half of
the graph up and down.</p>
<h2 class="western">Target range: low-high</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The higher side of
the display is colored differently so you can see high values easier.
The same is true for low values. A red line is displayed to show the
too low side of the display.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucose-axis numbers LEFT</h2>
<p>Place the numbers of the glucose level in the graph on the left of
the screen. Useful if you want to place your current glucose in the
middle of the screen, for example in Wear OS.</p>
<h2 class="western">Invert screen</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Turn the display
upside down. It is switch on by default, because otherwise I did now
and then accidentally touch OK while scanning a sensor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Some people ask for
portrait mode, but I have turned that off, because it is totally
inappropriate for the display of the glucose graph.</p>
<h2 class="western">Nfc sound</h2>
<p>Make sound during scanning in addition to vibration.</p>
<h2 class="western">Scanning starts app</h2>
<p>If checked this app will be started when you scan a sensor via NFC
even if this app is not displayed. If multiple apps have this
setting, android will display a chooser from which to select which
app you want to use. Somehow choosing one doesn't work and selecting
one to be chosen the next time neither. So in this case you can't
scan without an app in the foreground. Turning it off in this app,
will make it possible that at least one app can be activated this
way.</p>
<p>If you have root access, you can also disable NFC activation of
Abbott's Librelink app (doesn't work with Libre3):</p>
<p>Become root in adb shell or termux, and type:</p>
<p>pm disable
com.freestylelibre.app.nl/com.librelink.app.ui.common.NFCScanActivity</p>
<p>On Librelink 2.7.1 and lower you had to press:</p>
<p>pm disable
com.freestylelibre.app.nl/com.librelink.app.ui.common.ScanSensorActivity</p>
<p><span lang="en-US">com.freestylelibre.app.nl is here the Dutch
version of Librelink, this should be replaced with the version you
are using. You can find its name by typing</span> <span lang="en-US">(even
without root):</span></p>
<p>pm list package freestylelibre</p>
<p>Afterwards, you can still use Librelink for scanning when it is in
the foreground, but it will not be started otherwise. Librelink 2.5.2
and higher crash themselves if they detect root. But in Magisk you
can easily hide root by renaming Magisk and adding individual apps to
the denylist (Magisk 24.3) or Magiskhide (Magisk 23.0). You should
also add Juggluco to the denylist. Except when you use US Freestyle
Libre 2 sensors, you can also use an older version of Librelink
without root check.</p>
<p>Without root, under adb shell, you can also disable the whole app:</p>
<p>pm disable-user --user 0 com.freestylelibre.app.nl</p>
<p>Before calling Abbott customer service, you can re-enable it with:</p>
<p>pm enable com.freestylelibre.app.nl</p>
<h2 class="western">Libreview</h2>
<p>Connect with Libreview to send Freestyle Libre 2 and 3 glucose
values and amounts to Libreview and to get the account id used during
Freestyle Libre 3 sensor activation. Touch to change settings.</p>
<h2 class="western">Librelink broadcast</h2>
<p>Sends the Librelink broadcast (originally send by the patched
German Librelink app 2.3.0), to send the Bluetooth glucose stream
data every minute to xDrip. In xDrip you need to set Libre2 (patched
App) as hardware data source. The glucose values displayed in xDrip
are different from the values it receives. For some reason xDrip only
updates its value every 5 minutes, probably because it was made for
devices that send only once per 5 minutes (A watch face connected to
xDrip regularly displayed more than 9 minute old values.) In
addition, xDrip displays its own interpretation of received glucose
values. Mirror devices can also sent to xDrip.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/jakobheyman/xdripJH">https://github.com/jakobheyman/xdripJH</a>
for an attempt to update the glucose value of xDrip every minute.</p>
<p>Juggluco can also directly contact with xDrip watch apps, so that
the watch app displays more recent glucose values. To use this
feature check <i>&quot;xDrip webserver&quot;</i> in the left menu
under <b>Watch</b>. See Help under left menu-&gt;watch for more
information. Only one app can listen to the network port used by the
xDrip webserver, so you need to turn off &quot;<i>xDrip webservice</i>&quot;
in xDrip itself if you want to make use of the one in Juggluco.</p>
<h2 class="western">xDrip broadcast</h2>
<p>Send the same broadcast as turned on in xDrip with
&quot;<i>Settings-&gt;Inter-app settings-&gt;Broadcast locally&quot;</i>
(com.eveningoutpost.dexdrip.BgEstimate). Apps like AndroidAPS listen
to it. Apps targeting Android 11 or higher need to add the following
to AndroidManifest.xml for it to work: 
</p>
<p>&lt;queries&gt; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;package
android:name=&quot;tk.glucodata&quot;/&gt; <br/>
&lt;/queries&gt; 
</p>
<p>Every minute Juggluco sends a glucose value to all apps listening
to this broadcast, xDrip only to a few well known applications,
except when you explicitly specify the name.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucodata broadcast</h2>
<p>A new broadcast that has the same function as the xDrip broadcast.
A simple example app that writes received glucose values to logcat
you can find here: <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/glucosebroadcast.html">Glucose
broadcasts</a>. If you specify Juggluco as data-source in G-Watch,
you need to turn on this broadcast.</p>
<p>The application apps listening to this broadcast are shown. Check
the apps you want to send this broadcast to.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucose in android status bar</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If set glucose
values streaming via Bluetooth are quietly displayed in a
notification and the android status bar. On some smartphones, the
glucose value is only shown in the Android status bar after changing
Androids notification settings. On Realme GT 5G for example, you have
to go to applist-&gt;Juggluco-&gt;manage notifications, tab on
glucoseNotification and turn off &quot;Set to Silent&quot;. &quot;Display
in status bar&quot; will now be shown turned on.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
You can also get an android notification by selecting <i>Notify</i>
in the left middle menu. In that case the notification will be sent
to some smartwatches, if it is configured that way. That works with
Garmin watches, I don't know if it works with anything else. Alarms
also generate notifications.</p>
<h2 class="western">Sensor via Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Selects whether this app connects via Bluetooth with a Freestyle
libre 2 or 3 sensor. This is needed for alarms and continual glucose
monitoring.</p>
<h2 class="western"><b>Alarms</b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal">Set high en low glucose alarms, loss
of signal alarm and value available notification.</p>
<h2 class="western">Number Labels</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Specify the labels
used for amounts. Go to a screen to determine which labels to use to
set amounts, like insulin doses, carbohydrate consumption and hours
spend playing football. If you also use the Garmin watch app
Kerfstok, these labels are sent to the watch app.</p>
<h2 class="western">Reminders</h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
Specify that an alarm should go of if you didn't enter a certain
amount of food or medication within a certain time period.</p>
<h2 class="western">Colors</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Change colors of
curves, scans and numbers.</p>
<h2 class="western"><br/>
