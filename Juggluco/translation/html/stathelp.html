<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1 class="western">Statistics</h1>
<p>Some statistics taken from <a href="https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/ambulatory-glucose-profile">AGP</a>
without a license, with some minor modifications.</p>
<p>The number of days analyzed can be modified by pressing the <b>Days</b>
button. The period ends at the time of the end of screen position and
spans the specified number of days back in time. All data are only
based on glucose values received every minute via Bluetooth from the
sensor (called <i>stream</i> in Juggluco).</p>
<p>On the left of the screen are the percentage of measurements
falling in certain glucose ranges.</p>
<h3 class="western">% of the time active</h3>
<p>The percentage of time Juggluco received glucose values from the
sensor.</p>
<h3 class="western">Estimated A1C</h3>
<p>Estimates H<span lang="en-US">bA1c with an old formula from
average glucose (Nathan</span> <span lang="en-US">et al (2008)). See
<a href="https://professional.diabetes.org/diapro/glucose_calc">https://professional.diabetes.org/diapro/glucose_calc</a></span>
<span lang="en-US">for a calculator.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">It is shown here in</span> <span lang="en-US">case
people are looking for the value shown in Abbott's Libre</span> <span lang="en-US">2
app. GMI is a 2018 replacement for this indicator. </span>
</p>
<h3 class="western">Glucose Management Indicator (GMI)</h3>
<p><span lang="en-US">Calculated from the average glucose with a
certain generally used formula (see <a href="https://www.jaeb.org/gmi/">https://www.jaeb.org/gmi/</a>).
It is an empirically determined prediction of HbA1c (also called
A1c), given in percentage and mmol/mol.</span> <span lang="en-US">For
me personally Estimated A1C is a better predictor than GMI, but it is
used in Abbott's Libre 3 app.</span></p>
<h3 class="western">Glucose Variability:</h3>
<p>The coefficient of variation (%CV), as a measure of glucose
variability. Higher values mean that the glucose level is less
constant.</p>
<h3 class="western">Summary graph</h3>
<p>(Only present when at least 9 days of stream glucose values are
available).</p>
<p>All stream glucose values in this period are taken to draw a
composite graph showing for every minute of the day how glucose
values were distributed. The black or white median line shows the
glucose value below which 50 percent of the glucose values lie at
each minute of the day. The lightest blue is the area in which all
values lie. Somewhat darker blue the area around the median wherein
90% of the values lie. The darkest blue the area around the median of
50 percent of the values. If you see the borders of the area's as
lines, you can also portray it as follows: Under the lowest line are
0% of the values, under the second lowest line (between the lightest
blue and the middle dark blue) 5% of the values, below the third line
(between the darkest blue and middle dark blue) 25 % of values, below
the black line 50% of values. Followed by 75%, 95% and 100%. 
</p>
<p>Out of aesthetic reasons the curve is smoothed with a binomial
filter.</p>
<p>Tap the screen to close the Summary graph, except that when
tapping the left or right border the graph moves backwards or
forwards in the day. The curve can also be moved back and forwards by
scrolling. The time scale can be changed by moving two fingers to or
from each other.</p>
