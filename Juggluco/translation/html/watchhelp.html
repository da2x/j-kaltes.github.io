<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">This view is used to
solve connection problems with Kerfstok
(<a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/b6348ccc-86d8-4780-8013-d9e19fed5260">https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/b6348ccc-86d8-4780-8013-d9e19fed5260</a>
(see also <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Kerfstok/index.html">https://www.juggluco.nl/Kerfstok/index.html</a>).
Kerfstok is a watch app for programmable Garmin smartwatches with
touchscreen. Kerfstok has the following uses:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Enter numbers
	and exchange them with Juggluco;</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Displays the
	stream glucose value received from Juggluco;</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Displays this
	glucose value during sport, while also showing speed and distance.
	The activity will be recorded and can be displayed in Garmin's
	connect app.</p>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">This watch app can
connect via Bluetooth with Juggluco to exchange amounts and
continually display your current glucose value. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">When a problem
arrives, can this screen help to find its cause:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">First, your watch
name should be shown &quot;<i>CONNECTED</i>&quot;. If not, solve the
problem in Garmin's Connect app. Second, Kerfstok should be started
on your watch. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes the
connection between watch and phone is disrupted. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If Send status is
FAILURE_DURING_TRANSFER, you can do one or all of the following:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">- Switch Bluetooth
off and on, and thereafter press <i>Reinit</i>;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">- Reboot the watch
(nearly always successful, but sometimes it has to be done multiple
times);</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">- Reboot the phone
(last option).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">For other problems
force stopping the Garmin connect app, starting it again and pressing
reinit can be of use.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If there is a proper
connection and for some reason the amounts on watch and phone are out
of sync, you can press <b>Sync, </b>to make them send the numbers
they haven't sent yet, to each other.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">On startup of
Juggluco, <i>Sync</i> is automatically called. This means that after
you reinstall Kerfstok, all numbers will also be removed in Juggluco.
The only way to keep these numbers, is to make a mirror and send it
back to Juggluco. Be careful because the mirror also is immediately
synced with its original. To function as a backup, all connection
with the original should be broken at some point in time. You can
also connect the watch to a device that is a mirror (left middle
menu-&gt;Mirror) of the device in which you entered the numbers.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Refresh</b>
rewrites this dialog with new information (e.g. after Reinit or
Sync).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Checking &quot;<b>Glucose</b><b>&quot;</b>
determines if glucose values are sent to the watch.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes a button
named &quot;<b>Send Queue</b><b>&quot;</b> is shown; this means that
there are messages that are not yet sent to the watch. Normally they
will be sent automatically in due time, but sometimes this was
interrupted and pressing on <i>Send queue</i> will continue the
sending. But if it was not sent because of a broken connecting this
has very little benefit. Pressing <i>Send Queue </i>during an ongoing
transaction can break the connection.</p>
