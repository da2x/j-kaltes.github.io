First I published on <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/threads/glucose-value-differences-between-freestyle-libre-2-apps.185472/">www.diabetes.co.uk</a>.
There it was removed. Then I posted it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/rfbkwd/glucose_value_differences_between_freestyle_libre/">www.reddit.com</a>
referring to the previous removal and there it was also removed.
Thereafter, I posted it on <a href="https://forum.diabetes.org.uk/boards/threads/glucose-value-differences-between-freestyle-libre-2-apps.97381/"><span lang="en-US">forum.diabetes.org.uk</span></a>
mentioning the previous two removals and it was also removed. Later
all kind of fragments of this text emerged on google search, for I
don't know what reasons.</p>
<h1 class="western">Glucose value differences between FreeStyle Libre
2 apps</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">There
are several ways to get continues glucose monitoring from a</span>
<span lang="en-US">FreeStyle Libre 2</span> <span lang="en-US">sensor.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">As with FreeStyle
Libre 1, you can place Bluetooth sensor on top of a FreeStyle Libre 2
sensor, like MiaoMiao, DiaBox and Blucon. New with FreeStyle Libre 2
are apps that directly get glucose values from the sensor like the
patched Librelink app+ xdrip and Juggluco. (On some people Diabox
gives the impression to do the same, but that is not true. Diabox can
scan Freestyle libre 2 sensors and displays the scanned value in the
same way as Juggluco displays values received via Bluetooth. The
value in Diabox value is also present with Bluetooth turned off and a
constant value stays in the android status bar forever. In contrast,
Juggluco refreshes this value very minute with the glucose value
received via Bluetooth and removes the values if for three minutes it
didn't receive a new glucose value.)</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The LibreLink app
scans a sensor, it doesn't display the raw values it receives from
the sensor. The app processes the data received from the sensor to
come to the glucose values shown to the user and used for alarms.
FreeStyle Libre 1 apps like Glimp and Liapp, did give their own
interpretation of the raw sensor readouts. None of the apps who are
used with FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors does so. All work like the
patched version of Librelink: they use part of the Librelink app to
interpret the raw sensor readouts.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The value the
alternative apps give is different because they use an old version of
Librelink to interpret the data. This version is nearly always the
one also used by the patched librelink app, namely the German version
of Librelink 2.3.0.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">How they incorporate
this app differs. The so called patched version of the Librelink app
is the most open about this. It changes some code in Librelink 2.3.0
so that it sends data to xdrip (and optionally turns of verifications
and communication with Abbott). What is less well-known is that it
also contains an unmodified version of the Librelink app in
assets/original.apk of its apk, there by doubling its size. As
android installs an app the APK stays in the device. When the patched
Librelink is run it extracts assets/original.apk out of the apk and
saves it in 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">/data/data/com.freestylelibre.app.de/no_backup/original.apk.
Thus the the installed version of the patched Librelink contains
three times Librelink 2.3.0.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">DiaBox is not very
different. In res/raw/original_apk it contains the German Librelink
2.3.0 and as it is run it is saved in
/data/data/com.outshineiot.diabox/filesbase111.apk 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It also contains
libDataProcessing.so libMathRuntimeChecks.so libSecureKeyBoxJava.so
out of Librelink 2.3.0.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">LinkBluCon and the
non-us Tomato app from Miaomiao both contain contain the German
version of Librelink 2.3.0 in res/raw/original_apk and
lib/arm64-v8a/libDataProcessing.so and the directory tree in
java/com/abbottdiabetescare/flashglucose/sensorabstractionservice<span lang="zxx">.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The US 14 days
version of the Tomato app for miaomiao contains the US version of
Librelink 2.2.1 in res/raw/original_apk.</p>
<p><span lang="zxx">Out of legal reasons, the Juggluco package at
Google play doesn't contain anything from Abbott, but when run for
the first</span> <span lang="zxx">time</span> <span lang="zxx">it
takes l</span>ibDataProcessing.so out of the installed Librelink or
asks the user to download it if Librelink is not present (or only the
old, patched, Librelink is present). Juggluco is the only that
doesn't use any of the Librelink Java code.Because Juggluco uses
<span lang="zxx">l</span>ibDataProcessing.so from the new versions of
Abbotts Librelink, it gives the same glucose values as the new
versions of Librelink. And there is a large change between Librelink
2.3.0 and Librelink 2.4.2. There after the values have not changed
anymore.</p>
