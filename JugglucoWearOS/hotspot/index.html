<p><a href="https://j-kaltes.github.io/Juggluco/mgdL/index.html">Juggluco</a> is now ported to Wear OS. It consists of an adaptation of the smartphone version to the smaller screen of the watch and a watch
face that shows the time, the current glucose value received every
minute and four slots for complications.</p>

<p>Every sensor has to be initialized by the smartphone version of
Juggluco, that sends the sensor data to the watch version.
Thereafter, there are two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Keep the sensor connected with the smartphone and sends the
	data from the smartphone to the watch by TCP;</p>
      <li>
        <p>If you have a watch with good functioning Bluetooth, you can also try
          a direct connection between watch and sensor.</p>
      </li>
</ul>

    Exact instructions on how to get the watch working is given in the Smartphone version of Juggluco (>2.3.1) under Left menu-> watch-> Wearos Config -> Help.
    </p>
    <h2>Watch-sensor connection </h2>
    <p>I have only experience with Samsung Galaxy Watch4. With about half of the
      sensors Watch4 has a good connection, with the other half it had so much
      connection errors, that I had to switch to an indirect connection with the
      sensor.</p>
    <h2>Watch-phone connection</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> Connecting the sensor
      indirectly with the watch always worked very well. For this to work there
      has to be an IP/TCP connection between phone and watch. This can in two
      ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Give the phone an
          external connection. If the phone has an external connection, you can
          turn off Wi-Fi on the watch. This external connection is not used by
          Juggluco, but there is a TCP over Bluetooth connection between watch
          and phone when such an external connection exists. The external
          connection can be Wi-Fi, mobile data, personal hotspot, bluetooth
          tethering etc. After switching connection or getting out of reach, the
          new connection is sometimes not immediately recognized. You can make
          it recognized by switching Wi-FI, Mobile Data or Bluetooth OFF-and-ON
          on the phone;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Create a portable
          hotspot on the smartphone and select this portable hotspot as the
          Wi-Fi connection on your watch. Sometimes this does work for hours
          without disruption, but there comes a moment that it stops
          functioning. The watch doesn't establish a connection any more with
          the portable hotspot. Possibly rebooting the watch helps.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="western">What to do when
Juggluco on the watch stops receiving data from Juggluco on the
phone?</h2>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">See that <b>Direct
sensor-watch connection</b> is turned <b>off</b> in the phone Left
menu-&gt;Watch-&gt;Wearos Config.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">First of all turn
Bluetooth On in both watch and phone. Then switch WIFI off and on in
one of them, if that doesn't work, try the other or try the same a
second time (Turning Bluetooth off and on can also be effective if tcp is redirected through Bluetooth.) Hereafter you sometimes have to go to Left (middle) Menu-&gt; Mirror and
press sync in phone and watch.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible that
the connection between Juggluco's on watch and phone doesn't work,
because it was changed, therefore some screenshots are shown here of
a functioning connection. The shown IP is automatically determined and exchanged via Bluetooth and don't need to be specified manually. The label is a watch identifier also shown in Watch->Wearos Config.</p><p>If you want to reinstall the watch version,
you should remove the existing connection on the phone in Left-middle
menu-&gt; Mirror, by touching the connection and pressing <i>Delete</i>.
After reinstalling the watch version of Juggluco you can go again to
Watch-Wearos Config and press <i>Init Watch app</i>. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is very important
that always enough storage space is available. If at a critical
moment the device is out of storage space, it is possible that the
some files are not created the right way and you have to reinstall
Juggluco again with enough storage space.</p>

<h2 class="western">
Starting a new Sensor</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">(US-like sensors
always need to be started with the Libre 2 app, thereafter do the
same as described hereunder.)</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">When <i>&quot;Direct
sensor-watch connection&quot;</i> is turned OFF, everything should be
the same as when no watch is connected to the smartphone. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">With <i>&quot;Direct
sensor-watch connection&quot;</i> ON you should scan the sensor a few
times. After warm-up period, the watch should get a Bluetooth
connection with the sensor. Sometimes some more scans are needed
after the warm-up period. Sometimes this isn't enough, then
restarting Juggluco on the watch, by force closing it and starting it
again, may help. If this doesn't work, you can turn OFF <i>&quot;Direct
sensor-watch connection&quot;</i><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal">and
try it that way. Thereafter you can turn </span><i>&quot;Direct
sensor-watch connection&quot;</i><i> ON</i><span style="font-style: normal">
again.</span></p>
    <h5>How to get it? </h5>
    <p>You should be able to find Juggluco in Google Play on your watch, not on your phone or computer</p>
