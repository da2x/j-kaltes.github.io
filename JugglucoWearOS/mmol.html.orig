      is now ported to Wear OS. It consists of an adaptation of the smartphone
      version to the smaller screen of the watch and a watch face that shows the
      time, the current glucose value received every minute and four
      complication slots.</p>

    <p>Every sensor has to be initialized by the smartphone version of Juggluco,
      that sends the sensor data to the watch version. Thereafter, there are two
      possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Keep the sensor connected with the smartphone and sends the data from
          the smartphone to the watch by TCP;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you have a watch with good functioning Bluetooth, you can also try
          a direct connection between watch and sensor.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Exact instructions on how to get the watch working is given in the
      Smartphone version of Juggluco (&gt;2.3.1) under Left menu-&gt; watch-&gt;
      Wearos Config -&gt; Help.</p>
    <h2>Watch-sensor connection </h2>
    <p>I have only experience with Samsung Galaxy Watch4. With about half of the
      sensors Watch4 has a good connection, with the other half it had so much
      connection errors, that I had to switch to an indirect connection with the
      sensor. The last time a sensor that previously had too much connection
      errors worked well, when I powered off my smartphone after switching the
      sensor connection from the phone to the watch. The connection stayed well
      also after I booted the phone.</p>
    <h2>Watch-phone connection</h2>
    <img src="PrivateDNS.jpg" alt="PrivateDNS" style="object-fit:contain; width:auto;		    height:11.5cm;"
      align="right">
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
Connecting the sensor indirectly with the watch should always be possible, but the phone needs an external connection for it to work. A connection of the watch with a
      portable hotspot on the phone will stop, without such an external
      connection. If the phone has an external connection, you can turn off
      Wi-Fi on the watch. This external connection is not used by Juggluco, but
      there is only a TCP over Bluetooth connection between watch and phone if
      such an external connection exists. The external connection can be Wi-Fi,
      mobile data, personal hotspot, Bluetooth tethering etc. For more on this
      topic see: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220428115244/https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-Watch/Portable-Bluetooth-connection/td-p/2254198">Portable
        connection</a>.</p>
	<p>
	Sometimes there are general disconnection problems between phone and watch: The android companion app can't connect with the Watch. This can often be solved by rebooting the phone. Another method is to find Bluetooth in the list of apps (including system apps) in Android settings on your phone and press <i>Clear Data</i>. Nothing untoward has befallen me, after I did that and the phone could again connect with the watch (After I did the same with "Google Play Services" on my phone I had to do a factory reset on my watch).</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If you are afraid that
      turning on Mobile Data will generate costs, you can make that trying to
      use the internet results in an error. You can for example set Private DNS
      to an arbitrary name, so that every time someone asks for the IP of a
      hostname, this will fail; making it impossible to connect to another host
      using its hostname.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> The question arises what
      will happen if you are in a situation where you are unable to form a
      mobile data connection because its out of reach? I think that the
      connection will stop functioning. When I switched mobile phone provider,
      the connection stopped at the moment the provider of the SIM I was still
      using, turned off the connection. One possibility is to take your tablet
      with you and on that tablet create a portable hotspot and connect the
      phone (but not the watch) with that hotspot. Now there will also be a TCP
      over Bluetooth connection created between watch and phone. If someone
      knows a better solution, let me know.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To make it possible to
      create a portable hotspot on the phone and connect the watch to it without
      the phone having an external connection, Juggluco 2.9.6 adds the
      possibility to keep on WIFI on the watch.</p>
    <p>After switching connection or returning after getting out of reach, the
      new connection is sometimes not immediately recognized. You can make it
      recognized by switching Wi-FI, Mobile Data or Bluetooth OFF-and-ON on the
      phone. </p>
    <h2>How to get it?</h2>
    <p>You should be able to find Juggluco in Google Play on your watch.
      Detailed instructions are giving in Juggluco under Left
      menu-&gt;Watch-&gt;Wearos Config-&gt;Help. The same text plus some
      pictures is given <a href="http://jkaltes.byethost16.com/JugglucoWearOS/install/mmol/index.html">here</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="western">What to do when Juggluco on the watch stops receiving
      data from Juggluco on the phone?</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">See that <b>Direct
        sensor-watch connection</b> is turned <b>off</b> in the phone Left
      menu-&gt;Watch-&gt;Wearos Config.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">First of all turn Bluetooth
      On in both watch and phone. Then switch WIFI off and on in one of them, if
      that doesn't work, try the other or try the same a second time (Turning
      Bluetooth off and on can also be effective if tcp is redirected through
      Bluetooth.) Hereafter you sometimes have to go to Left (middle) Menu-&gt;
      Mirror and press sync in phone and watch.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is possible that the
      connection between Juggluco's on watch and phone doesn't work, because it
      was changed, therefore some screenshots are shown here of a functioning
      connection. The shown IP is automatically determined and exchanged via
      Bluetooth and don't need to be specified manually. The label is a watch
      identifier also shown in Watch-&gt;Wearos Config.</p>
    <p>If you want to reinstall the watch version, you should remove the
      existing connection on the phone in Left-middle menu-&gt; Mirror, by
      touching the connection and pressing <i>Delete</i>. After reinstalling
      the watch version of Juggluco you can go again to Watch-Wearos Config and
      press <i>Init Watch app</i>. </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is very important that
      always enough storage space is available. If at a critical moment the
      device is out of storage space, it is possible that the some files are not
      created the right way and you have to reinstall Juggluco again with enough
      storage space.</p>

    <h2 class="western"> Starting a new Sensor</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">(US-like sensors always
      need to be started with the Libre 2 app, thereafter do the same as
      described hereunder.)</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">When <i>"Direct
        sensor-watch connection"</i> is turned OFF, everything should be the
      same as when no watch is connected to the smartphone. </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">With <i>"Direct
        sensor-watch connection"</i> ON you should scan the sensor a few times.
      After warm-up period, the watch should get a Bluetooth connection with the
      sensor. Sometimes some more scans are needed after the warm-up period.
      Sometimes this isn't enough, then restarting Juggluco on the watch, by
      force closing it and starting it again, may help. If this doesn't work,
      you can turn OFF <i>"Direct sensor-watch connection"</i><i> </i><span style="font-style: normal">and
try
        it that way. Thereafter you can turn </span><i>"Direct sensor-watch
        connection"</i><i> ON</i><span style="font-style: normal"> again.</span></p>
    <h2 class="western"> Watchface difficulties</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes after an update
      of Juggluco, the appearance of the watch face has changed without any
      change in the program. For example the complications are not displayed.
      Changing to another watch face and back, let to the reappearance of the
      complications, but now lines appeared around the complications. Changing
      the color in the Watch face in the Watch companion app, led to the
      disappearance of these lines. </p>
