<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h4 class="western">No WIFI</h4>
<p>Currently Juggluco phone and watch are made to communicate via
WIFI. If you are out of the house you are expected to create a
portable hotspot on your phone. But the portable hotspot connection
is often disrupted. The connection using the IPs connecting via the
modem keep functioning probably because it is redirected to Bluetooth
when the WIFI connection is turned down to use less battery power.
This seems not to be the case when connected over a portable hotspot,
instead of that after some time no new glucose values are send over
and you have to awake the connection again. 
</p>
<h5 class="western">solution</h5>
<p>If your phone is connected via a DATA connection there is an other
option on the watch4. On the phone modify the automatically created
connection to &quot;Passive only&quot;, on the watch &quot;Active
Only&quot; and add on the watch as second ip 192.0.0.4. If your phone
has a data connection and you adb to the phone and press ifconfig you
should see this IP: 
</p>
<pre class="western">v4-rmnet_data2 Link encap:UNSPEC
          <span lang="en-US">inet addr:192.0.0.4  P-t-P:192.0.0.4  Mask:255.255.255.255</span>
          <span lang="en-US">UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1472  Metric:1</span>

      </pre><p>
This way you can also turn off WIFI on your watch, while it is turned
on on your phone and still receive reliably glucose values from the
watch to the phone (or the other way around). Later I will try to
automate this.
