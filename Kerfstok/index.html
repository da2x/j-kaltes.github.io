      is a Garmin watch app to enter and display numbers, display the glucose
      level received from FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors and record activities and
      show activity metrics on its display. This can all be used by a diabetic
      patient (or an endurance sport athlete wanting to detect periods of
      hypoglycemia.)</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"> After starting Kerfstok,
      you see the following chooses: input, view, Watch face, Sport. By pressing
      on Input, you can add numbers, View to view them, Watch face brings you to
      a screen showing beside the time, date, battery level and heart rate, also
      your current glucose level measured by the Freestyle libre 2 sensor and
      send via Low energy bluetooth to Juggluco and sent again via low energy
      Bluetooth to your Garmin watch. You can go back to the main menu, by using
      the back movement. On my Vivoactive 3, that is swiping to the right.</p>

    <h1 class="western"> Numbers</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US"> In <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.glucodata">Juggluco</a>
      you can specify labels to be used for numbers entered and displayed in
      Kerfstok. Possible labels are kinds of Insulin like NovoRapid, Levemir,
      food consumed like Carbohydrate. The number entered can mean an amount of
      the label and is associated with a certain time.<img src="calc.png" name="Image5"
        width="218" height="218" align="left" border="0"> For example: <i>23
        May 2022 13:33 Dextro 15</i>. In Kerfstok these numbers can be viewed in
      a list sorted on time. There you can also specify shortcuts to easily
      insert numbers like the fraction carbohydrate of certain foods. These
      amounts are sent to this android app and displayed there. Amounts can also
      be given in Juggluco which will be sent back to this watch app. If you
      touch Input, in the main screen, a list of labels for amount of food or
      insulin is shown (as you specified under Settings, Number labels in
      Juggluco).<font color="#000000"> <img src="mem.png" name="Image6" width="218"
          height="218" align="right" border="2"> </font>You can page up and
      down by swiping up and down. By touching a label you come in a number dial
      view, in which you can specify a number by touching the individual digits.
      The created number will be saved by touching the middle of the screen.
      Swiping upwards brings up a view showing arithmetic operations (+,-,/,*,^)
      and a point (.). You can insert one of them by touching it. 'C' clears the
      screen, 'Round' rounds to whole numbers. If you have added arithmetic
      operators, the result will be calculated by pressing on the created
      formula in the middle of the screen. Touching a second time, will save the
      result and leave the screen.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US">Swiping
      downwards in the dial view, brings you in a view showing previous values,
      touching one of them inserts them in the middle of the screen.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US"> Kerfstok also
      has hand calculator like memory places. Long touching at the left of the
      middle of the dial, can be used to remember the displayed value, a view of
      memory places is shown (M0,M1,M2,M3) touching one of them remembers the
      current display in that location. By Long pressing the right side of the
      middle of the screen, you can insert the number by pressing one of the
      shown memory places (e.g. M0).</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US"> After swiping
      to the left of the screen, a list of shortcuts is shown. You can create
      these shortcuts in Juggluco under Settings, Shortcuts. Pressing one of the
      shortcuts inserts its value in the middle of the number dial. Shortcuts
      can be numbers (e.g. bread - 0.45), but also numbers plus arithmetic
      operators (e.g. bread - *0.45) depending on your soft keyboard.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US"> After
      pressing the middle of the dial, the number is saved. You can view saved
      numbers by touching View in the main menu. You can edit one by touching
      it. Touching the hour, minute, day, month , year, label or amount brings
      you in a view were you can change it. Afterwards press save. Del deletes
      the number. Swipe right to leave the screen without saving.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US">In the list of
      saved numbers, you can page up and down by swiping down and up. Swiping to
      the left moved one day back. Swiping to the right brings you to the
      previous screen.</p>

    <h1 class="western">Glucose</h1>
    <p>The android app Juggluco connects with Freestyle libre 2 sensors and
      receives every minute a glucose value via bluetooth. Juggluco can sent
      this value to Kerfstok. Kerfstok contains a kind of watch face showing
      beside the time, date, battery level and heart rate, also the glucose
      level received from Juggluco.</p>
    <h1 class="western"> Sport</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>To be able to show this glucose value all the time and still engage in
      activities, it is possible to record activities and display the result in
      Garmin's connect app. Current speed and distance e.g. are displayed in
      Kerfstok. You can select from all sport and sub-sports available through
      Garmin's health SDK, but GPS is always turned on, so it is only
      appropriate for sports containing outdoor movement.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US"><img src="startsport.png"
        name="Image2" width="260" height="260" align="right" border="0"> Sport
      let you choose out of all kind of activities by touching the currently
      displayed activity and selecting one activity out of a list of activities.
      By swiping up and down (on my Vivoactive 3) you can page down and up the
      list. Touching an activity selects it. Here after you can select a subtype
      of the activity, by touching the current subtype (e.g. <i>generic</i>).
      If you selected <i>Cycling</i>, you can select for example <i>mountain</i>,
      <i><span style="font-weight: normal">gravel</span></i> or <i>road</i>. By
      pressing at the top of the screen you can select the lap size in mile or
      km, depending on your watch settings. This means that after distances of
      this size, you watch vibrates. These laps are also shown in Garmin's
      connect app. If you specify 0, no laps are generated.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US">The activity
      is started by touching Start (or on my watch the only button). This let
      you to the sport view: In the top of the screen the time is shown, there
      under your current glucose value. In the middle on the right is your
      current speed; on the right under the middle, the current distance and at
      the bottom of the screen your heart rate.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US">Now and then
      at the left side of the middle, when a lap distance is reach the time used
      for this distance is shown. You can also manually add a lap, by touching
      two times, or touching for a long time. Then the time is shown between now
      and the previous manual lap or the start of the activity.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%" lang="en-US">(Garmin
      Connect doesn't differentiate between automatic and manual laps.) From the
      sport view, you can go back to the start view and register a number,
      without interrupting the recording of the activity. To pause or end the
      activity I press the button on my watch (on a watch with multiple buttons,
      you probably have to press one of them).</p>
