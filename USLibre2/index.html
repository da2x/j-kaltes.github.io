    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">For this you need binpatch:
      <a class="western" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/binaryeditor/files/binpatch">https://sourceforge.net/projects/binaryeditor/files/binpatch</a>

    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">When everything goes will you get this file:
      <a class="western" href="https://apkfab.com/libre-2/test.freestylelibre2.us/apk?h=c23a18f939207ee342d2054c551274f1b91c69a87f9691ac78f94eb49bc4a056">Patched US Libre 2 app</a>
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">This makes it possible to
      send glucose values from the Libre 2 app to <a href="https://j-kaltes.github.io/Juggluco">Juggluco</a>.
      You needed this app to use US Freestyle Libre 2 sensors with Juggluco.
      From Juggluco 2.2.1 on Juggluco can connect directly with US Freestyle
      libre 2 sensors and this app is probably superfluous.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">There are some differences
      with the unpatched version: Normally the US Libre2 app doesn't scan
      sensors that were started with Freestyle Reader or another device. This
      restriction is removed. The unpatched US libre 2 app can't scan European
      sensors, the patched version can. The unpatched version always displays
      glucose values in mg/dL, in the patched version you can choice between
      mmol/L and mg/dL. The patched version has removed all contact with
      Abbott's servers and for that reason LibreView and most help menus don't
      work. Alarms don't work. Firebase analytics is partly removed and partly
      left intact. The authentication information is changed and I have disabled
      firebase in AndroidManifest.xml, but I still see <b>isEmailSend:POST</b>
      in logcat, so probably they just continue sending information when turned
      off (<i>Firebase Analytics</i>), without displaying the data to the
      Firebase account holder. I changed the Application Id, so you can install
      it besides the unpatched Libre 2 app. It is also possible to receive
      glucose values via bluetooth on a device <a class="western" href="withoutnfc.html">without
        NFC</a>. The patched version is only available for <u>arm64</u>,
      because I couldn't find the unpatched <u>arm</u> Libre2 app. </p>

      alt="Juggluco's connection overview" title="Juggluco's connection overview">
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The Patched Libre 2 app
      makes use of Juggluco's Mirror function to send glucose values to
      Juggluco. Under the right menu the Item "Juggluco" is added. This opened a
      modified version of Juggluco's "Mirror" dialog. An example connection is
      already specified.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">To establish the Juggluco
      side of this example connection, you only need to open the Mirror dialog
      in Juggluco: Left middle menu, Mirror. Change port to 8118, save. Press '<i>Add
        Connection'</i>, change there port to 7117. Add the IP 127.0.0.1. Check
      '<i>Test Label</i>' and write libre2juggluco. Check '<i>Receive from</i>'
      and press Save. Now press '<i>Sync'</i>.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Now the Last scan and
      history values should be shown. Later the values via Bluetooth will
      arrive.</p>

      alt="Add connection" title="Add connection">
    <p> When making a connection between the patched Libre 2 app and Juggluco
      running on the same smartphone, you can use different IPs for local
      connection on the phone. Using 127.0.01 seems to be the simplest, but on
      my phone it worked better when I used the home net wlan IP. On a Realme GT
      5G phone I had turned battery optimization for Juggluco of at two place
      and allowed background at one place and still there were moments when the
      traffic between Libre 2 and Juggluco was stopped when using 127.0.0.1, but
      this didn't happen when using the home net wlan IP.</p>
