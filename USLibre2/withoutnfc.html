<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Without NFC</h1>
<p>To scan a Freestyle Libre 2 sensor, you need NFC and without first
scanning you don't get a Bluetooth connection with a sensor. But
there are ways to transfer information received by NFC to a phone
without NFC. Juggluco can use it's mirror function for this. A device
that receives scan and stream data from a phone with NFC also
receives the information to connect with the sensor via Bluetooth.
After it has received this information you only need remove this
connection (or turn it the other way around) and turn on &quot;Sensor
via Bluetooth&quot; and enable Bluetooth and turn off Bluetooth in
the phone that previously had Bluetooth contact with the sensor until
a connection is established.</p>
<p>Also the patched version of the US Libre 2.71 Android app, can be
installed on a phone without NFC. To make it connect with the sensor
via Bluetooth you have to copy the information from another phone
with NFC that has gained contact with the sensor via NFC.</p>
<p>You have first to enable developer options on your phone, enable
<a href="https://www.isunshare.com/android/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-android.html">USB
debugging</a> in developer options and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/">install
adb</a> on your computer</p>
<p>Install the patched US libre 2 on both phones and page through the
setup until the app is ready for scanning. Scan the patched Libre 2
app on the phone with NFC a few times. Then kill the app on both
phones.</p>
<p>Get the data from the phone with NFC:</p>
<p>Connect the phone with NFC to the computer via USB to the apps
data directory:</p>
<p>On Computer:</p>
<p><b>adb shell run-as test.freestylelibre2.us tar
-cf&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;all.tar</b> 
</p>
<p>Disconnect the phone with NFC and connect the phone without NFC.
Login to Phone without NFC:<p>
<p><b>adb shell</b><br/>
<b>run-as test.freestylelibre2.us</b><br/>
<b>rm -rf *</b><br/>
<b>exit</b><br/>
<b>exit</b></p>
<p>Back on Computer:</p>
<p><b>cat all.tar | adb shell run-as test.freestylelibre2.us tar -xf
- </b>
</p>
<p>This will give a lot of <i>tar: chown 10379:10379 '.': Operation
not permitted</i> errors, but that is no problem. Now turn off
Bluetooth in the phone with NFC and turn on bluetooth in the phone
without NFC and start the patched Libre 2 app on the phone without
NFC and wait for the establishment of a Bluetooth connection and
setup Juggluco to receive glucose values from the patched US Libre 2
app.</p>
